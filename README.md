# UMD Data Challenge 2020
### Background
Over the summer in 2019, DOTS installed Numina sensors at 5 intersections on campus to count bikes, pedestrians, cars, buses, trucks and identify path of travel. The purpose of collecting traffic count sensor data is to improve DOTS’ ability to monitor traffic and understand travel behavior by pedestrians, bicyclists, and drivers over time.

### The dataset is explored in the following aspects:
•	Summarize (visualize) the time trend for traffic by each mode. 
•	Explain the dynamic observed.
• Using data analysis and visualization, come up with a few ideas to improve transportation planning and traffic management on campus
• Build a traffic count predictive model using data science techniques and explain the usefulness of the model.
• Use traffic and count data to measure the campus’ social, economic, and health benefits to walking, biking, and taking transit.
